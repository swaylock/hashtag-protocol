## We're migrating to Polygon

### Why the move?

Simply put: faster & cheaper transactions.

Sadly, a high-volume, Web3 tagging protocol and Ethereum Mainnet are
incompatible. Therefore we are pivoting and redeploying Hashtag Protocol on
Polygon, arguably the most decentralized, battle tested & scalable Layer 2.


### Our new sandbox on Polygon Mumbai testnet

Please use this interface to experiment with tagging any
NFT on Ethereum or Polygon with any hashtag string you can imagine. If the
hashtag you tag with is unique, a HASHTAG token (itself an NFT) will be minted
and your address is logged within it as the Creator. In the future, Creators
will receive a royalty when the HASHTAG token is purchased at auction.

Please note, the Mumbai sandbox is for **testing purposes only**. No tokens or
tagging data will be migrated to Polygon Mainnet.

[Learn more](https://docs.hashtag-protocol.org/essentials/participants.html)
about Publishers, Creators & Taggers, the three early market participants of the
Hashtag Protocol.

### Early adoption opportunity

For Publishers, we are seeking five "launch partners" who wish to implement
decentralized tagging on their platform. As early adopters, launch partners will have
opportunity to be publisher of record for the highest value HASHTAG tokens.
If a HASHTAG token is purchased at auction, the Publisher of record will receive
a portion of the sale revenue.

Mind you, minting a HASHTAG token NFT on Ethereum Mainnet usually costs over
$100 in gas. However, all HASHTAG tokens minted on Ethereum mainnet _will be
migrated_ immediately prior to relaunch on Polygon Mainnet. Therefore all token
provenance, including hashtag string, Creator address and Publisher address,
will be preserved on Polygon.

### What is Hashtag Protocol?

A new Web3 tagging standard that aims to do for content tagging what ENS,
Unstoppable Domains and Handshake have done for DNS.
